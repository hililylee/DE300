Set-up: 

In my S3 bucket called de300-lily-bucket, I have an Airflow folder for this Homework titled, "AirflowHW4/" 
In this folder, I uploaded my heart_disease(in).csv, requirements.txt, and config_hd.toml
I also included a dags folder which contains my python script

In order to view my Airflow, my MWAA Environment is called, "DE300LilyAirflow"
Click on the Airflow UI Link to view the HW4 Dag
